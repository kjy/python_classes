Note the somewhat inelegant way of invoking the parent class’ method. We explicitly refer to Pet.feed to get the method/function object. We invoke it with parentheses. However, since we are not invoking the method the normal way, with <obj>.methodname, we have to explicitly pass an instance as the first parameter. In this case, the variable self in Dog.feed() will be bound to an instance of Dog, and so we can just pass self: Pet.feed(self)."
