    "We could have made distance be a method of the Point class. Then, we would have called the first parameter self, and would have invoked it using the dot notation, as in the following code. Which way to implement it is a matter of coding style. Both work correctly. Most programmers choose whether to make functions be stand-alone or methods of a class based on whether the function semantically seems to be an operation that is performed on instances of the class. In this case, because distance is really a property of a pair of points and is symmetric (the distance from a to b is the same as that from b to a) it makes more sense to have it be a standalone function and not a method. Many heated discussions have occurred between programmers about such style decisions."

Let’s pull all these mechanics together in a slightly more interesting way than we got with the Point class. Remember Tamagotchis, the little electronic pets?

The sounds instance variable is initialized to be a copy of the class variable with the same name. The reason we make a copy of the list is that we will perform destructive operations (appending new sounds to the list). If we didn’t make a copy, then those destructive operations would affect the list that the class variable points to, and thus teaching a sound to any of the pets would teach it to all instances of the class!\n",

In response to teach(), the pet adds the new word to its list of words. In response to the hi() method, it prints out one of the words it knows, randomly picking one from its list of known words. Both hi() and teach() cause an invocation of the reduce_boredom() method. It decrements the boredom state by an amount that it reads from the class variable hunger_decrement.
